# CPS (C++ to PostScript)
CS 372 Project 2 -- Michael Bilan, Bradley Morton and Charles Emerson

## Introduction
This is a Software Construction exercise in design patterns. The goal of this project is to design and implement a high-level C++ shapes-language to PostScript translator.

## Success Criteria
Success occurs when the following are implemented and tested:

### Basic Shapes
- Circle(double radius)
- Polygon(int numSides, double sideLength)
- Rectangle(double width, double height)
- Spacer(double width, double height)
- Square(double sideLength)
- Triangle(double sideLength)

### Compound Shapes
- Rotated(Shape shape, RotationAngle rotationAngle)
- Scaled(Shape shape, double xScale, double yScale)
- Layered(Shape ... shapes)
- VerticallyStackedUp(Shape ... shapes)
- HorizontallyStackedRight(Shape ... shapes)
